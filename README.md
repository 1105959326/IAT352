# Vancouver Art Gallery
This team project for IAT 352 Internet Computing Technologies was developed in collaboration with Weijing Dong. We created a membership-based website showcasing free public art in downtown Vancouver. Non-logged-in users can filter information and view comments, while registered users can post comments and create personal favorite lists.

We utilized a MySQLi database for data management, HTML and CSS for the front-end interface, and PHP, jQuery, and AJAX for seamless front and back-end interaction.
