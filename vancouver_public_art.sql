The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today.

The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T\'uy\'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces.

('807', 'Tabay Nghuni Nzoo translates to “Beautiful Story” or “Your stories are very good”.\"I began the process of developing the art by thinking of Vancouver as a city and what has always stood out to me: the interplay of city and nature, the very direct relationship to water and the sea, the big skies. There has always been a deep appreciation of those who came before me tending to the land in such a way that even now natural beauty is a defining feature in a teeming city. The ancestors and spirit that sits deep in the land are always very apparent to me. I wanted this art then to reflect this and also to be fantastical — to engage both the land and the imagination.I used big colours that match dusk and dawn, I brought in highlights of the old meeting the new (the cherry blossoms versus the cedar), I focused on iconic landscapes within the geography that is Vancouver.  I depicted animals that we share space with everyday and perhaps do not see.  If you look close, you can identify them. I wanted to explore our connections with ancestors and spirit and life.\"', 'Mural', 'šx???ex?n Xwtl’a7shn (formerly Queen Elizabeth Theatre Plaza)', '', 'Digitally printed onto adhesive vinyl.', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/6ec9aef46775255cbfcd10df5dc9e6b5', '{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [-123.113948, 49.279993]}', 'Downtown', 'This artwork is part of a series of Indigenous artwork, commissioned through the City’s Indigenous Artist Call 2019.
